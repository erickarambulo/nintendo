# Google Sheets documentations

This is the documentation to track what changes and activities I made on **Google Sheets**. This will not only help me to train my skills at documentating, but also to make good habits for myself and my future employers, co-workers, and managers to be able to keep track
of what changes I had done to the Google Sheets or other programming languages.
