# Project: Nintendo's best selling video games

For this project, I used **Google Sheets** for this project to clean up and edit before taking it further for analyze stage instead of SQL query because this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codefantasy/list-of-best-selling-nintendo-games) have 7 columns and 430 rows total; therefore, it's a very small data file. 

The goal for this project is to show my skills in Google Sheets by checking data type consistency, dealing with missing values on **Genre** column, building a basic statistic with pivot table, and creating several data visualizations based on columns on Jupyter Notebook in Python programming language.

Take a look at the documentation.md file that I tracked myself of what I made changes on datasets. I hope you find this documentation very useful.

Also take a look at .py file for data visualizations that I created along with markdown in there. 

Enjoy!
