# Google Sheets Project: Nintendo's best selling video games

For this project, I used **Google Sheets** for this project instead of SQL query because this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codefantasy/list-of-best-selling-nintendo-games) have 7 columns and 430 rows total; therefore, it's a very small data file. 

The goal for this project is to show my skills in Google Sheets by checking data type consistency, dealing with missing values on **Genre** column, building a basic statistic with pivot table, and creating few data visualizations based on columns.

Take a look at the documentation that I tracked myself of what I made changes on datasets.

I hope you find this documentation very useful.

Enjoy!
