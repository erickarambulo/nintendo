# Project: Nintendo's best selling video games

For this project, I chose to use Google Sheets instead of SQL for data cleaning and editing before moving on to the analysis stage. This was because the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codefantasy/list-of-best-selling-nintendo-games) is relatively small, with only 7 columns and 430 rows, making it suitable for manipulation in Google Sheets.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in Google Sheets by:

- Verifying data type consistency
- Addressing missing values in the **Genre** column
- Constructing basic statistics using pivot tables

I also demonstrate the use of Google Sheets to create multiple data visualizations, such as:

- Line plots: Plot sales over time. âœ”
- Bar charts: Visualize the top-selling games, developers, and publishers. 
- Histograms: Analyze the distribution of sales and release dates.
- Scatter plots: Explore relationships between variables, such as sales vs. release year.

Not only basic data visualizations, but also advanced and in-depth analysis and visualizations, such as:

Genre analysis:
- Identify the most popular genres.
- Analyze sales trends for different genres over time.
- Compare sales performance between genres.

Platform analysis:
- Determine the best-selling platforms for Nintendo.
- Analyze the impact of different platforms on sales.

Developer and publisher analysis:
- Identify the top-performing developers and publishers.
- Analyze the factors contributing to their success.

I've been tracking the changes I made for Google Sheets and Python in a documentation [file](https://github.com/erickarambulo/nintendo/blob/main/documentation.md) called "documentation.md." Take a look, and I hope you find it very useful.

Enjoy!
