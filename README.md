# Project: Nintendo's best selling video games

For this project, I chose to use Google Sheets instead of SQL for data cleaning and editing before moving on to the analysis stage. This was because the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codefantasy/list-of-best-selling-nintendo-games) is relatively small, with only 7 columns and 430 rows, making it suitable for manipulation in Google Sheets.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The 'Sales' column does not indicate the amount of money earned. Instead, it represents the total number of game copies sold. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my skills in Google Sheets by:

- Verifying data type consistency
- Addressing missing values in the **Genre** column
- Constructing basic statistics using pivot tables

I also demonstrate the use of Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook as my IDE to create multiple data visualizations, such as:

- Line plots: Plot sales over time. ✔
- Bar charts: Visualize the top-selling games, developers, and publishers. ✔
- Histograms: Analyze the distribution of sales and release dates. ✔
- Scatter plots: Explore relationships between variables, such as sales vs. release year. ✔

Not only basic data visualizations, but also advanced and in-depth analysis and visualizations, such as:

Genre analysis:
- Identify the most popular genres. ✔
- Analyze sales trends for different genres over time. ✔
- Compare sales performance between genres. ✔

Platform analysis:
- Determine the best-selling platforms for Nintendo. ✔
- Analyze the impact of different platforms on sales. ✔

Developer and publisher analysis:
- Identify the top-performing developers and publishers. ✔
- Analyze the factors contributing to their success. ✔

I've been tracking the changes I made for Google Sheets in [documentation.md](https://github.com/erickarambulo/nintendo/blob/main/documentation.md) file. Take a look, and I hope you find it very useful. This file also contains analyses and data visualizations that I created by using Python in Jupyter Notebook as an IDE.

I've also attached the file, [nintendo.ipynb](https://github.com/erickarambulo/nintendo/blob/main/documentation.md), which showcases my honest and hard work on creating code with exceptional readability. This ensures that other coders can easily understand and adapt it for data visualizations.

Enjoy!
